# Abstract Classes in java
- Providing Re-usable code.
- Providing Base for the future class
- Forcing Subclass to implement required behavior

**Features of Abstract Classes** 
- Can Have constructors
- Can have both Concrete Methods and Abstract methods
- Provide Partial abstraction
  

# Interface vs Abstract class
- Connot create object.
- Supports Abstract methods
- But abstract class supports concrete methods as well
- Interface supports default and static
- Abstract class can have constructors but not in interface.
- Abstract class can have instances but in interface we have constants.
- Using abstract class we cannot do the multiple inheritance but interface can.
- Abstract class can implement interface as well.
- Both supports runtime polymorphism
- Abstract classes supports code reuse but using default minimal code reuse is possible in interface.
- Interface is the complete contract but abstract classes are partial.
